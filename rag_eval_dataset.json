We do this through a broad mix  \nof investments.\nThe Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income \nsecurities to diversify investment risks. The equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher  \nlong-term return.\nWe adopt an actively managed investment strategy, which we adjust in response to changing market conditions. Under normal \ncircumstances, our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with a higher \nguarantee and a larger proportion of higher-risk assets to insurance plans with lower guarantees. In doing so, we aim to match \nthe level of risk to the risk profiles of our products. We may utilise derivatives to manage risks or improve returns. We may also \nmake use of securities-lending to enhance returns.\nThe following paragraphs explain the current investment mix according to our investment strategy. Should there be any material \nchanges in the investment strategy, we will inform you of the changes and explain the reasons behind and their implications.\nThe investment mix of your plan\nThe current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\nAsset type Allocation (%)\nUSD-/HKD-denominated \npolicies\nFixed-income securities 55%\nEquity-type securities 45%\nOur guaranteed liabilities to the policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities.\nWe primarily invest in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade. A small portion of high-yield and emerging-market \nbonds may be included to improve yield and diversification.\nFor equity-type securities, most of the investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.",

Subject to market availability and opportunity, we may invest fixed-income \nsecurities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination and currency hedging may be used to reduce the  \ncurrency risk.\nWe invest globally to achieve diversification benefits and we currently have a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia which \nwill be reviewed regularly.\nWe actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.  \nGiven asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual \nallocation may vary from the target allocation above.

If we become insolvent, \nyou may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\nHow may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\nForeign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your \nbenefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions \napplicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits \nto other currencies.\nWhat are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\nThe liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any \nsurrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the \npremiums you paid.\nHow may inflation affect the value of your plan?\nWe expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have \nthe same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.\nWhat happens if you do not pay your premiums?\nYou should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will \nautomatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged \nat a rate as determined by us.

If we become insolvent, \nyou may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.  \nHow may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\nForeign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your \nbenefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions \napplicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits \nto other currencies.\nWhat are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan? \nThe liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any \nsurrender/withdrawal, especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the \npremiums you paid.\nHow may inflation affect the value of your plan? \nWe expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have \nthe same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefits intended to offset inflation.\nWhat happens if you do not pay your premiums?\nYou should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will \nautomatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged \nat a rate determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the \npolicy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as \nlosing the policy\u2019s coverage.\nWhy may we adjust your premiums?\nWe have the right to review and adjust the plan\u2019s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for \nany individual customer. \nWe may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment and persistency experience.Key risks",

Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign \ntax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority \nwhere the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis,  \nthe relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of \nthe account holder\u2019s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis. \n \nHong Kong has adopted the new rules into its legislation (please see the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 2016 \n(\u201cthe Amendment Ordinance\u201d) which came into effect on 30 June 2016). Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to \nfinancial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as \n\u201caccount holders\u201d. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to \nidentify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where \nthe account holder is an entity, its \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the  \nInland Revenue Department (\u201cIRD\u201d) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such \naccount holders.",
